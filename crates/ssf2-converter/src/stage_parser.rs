//! stage_parser — extract a geometry model from an SSF2 stage `.ssf`.
//!
//! SSF2 stages are SWF resources: a root `stageMC` MovieClip holds a `terrain`
//! container (the collision geometry), named boundary clips (`deathBoundary`,
//! `camBoundary`, `smashBallBoundary`), and per-player `pN_Start` / `pN_Spawn`
//! beacon instances. We walk the placement tree accumulating the FULL affine
//! matrix down each branch, then read each instance's WORLD axis-aligned bounding
//! box (the referenced shape's local bounds transformed by the compounded matrix).
//!
//! Output is in **Fraymakers stage coordinates**: SSF2 world coords minus the
//! `stageMC` origin (FrayTools and SSF2 share a y-down pixel space at 1:1 scale —
//! the battlefield floor is ~520px wide in both). The FM stage emitter consumes
//! this model directly. Read-only on the input file.
//!
//! Reuses [`crate::ssf::decompress`] (the DAT-archive aware path; the raw `swf`
//! decompressor fails on the install's DATs).
