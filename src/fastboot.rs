//! fastboot — the SINGLE definition of "what a quick boot launches".
//!
//! A quick (fast / headless) boot lands the engine straight in a live match instead
//! of parking the bridge at READY. The start-match is socket-driven on both engines
//! (Fraymakers `s`, SSF2 `SPAWN`+`GO`), so SOMETHING has to fire it once the engine is
//! ready. That decision — *whether* to autostart, *which* character, and the exact
//! launch command — used to live in four places (FM CLI, SSF2 CLI, FM GUI page-JS,
//! SSF2 GUI host) that didn't even agree. This module is the one home for it, shared by
//! every frontend (CLI + GUI) and parameterized by engine. Tweak fastboot here and both
//! the CLI and the GUI move together.
//!
//! The command is expressed in the engine-agnostic `spawn …` vocabulary (the same one a
//! user types); each transport translates it on the way out (FM: `command_to_wire` →
//! socket; SSF2: `run_command` → reflection). So this module never touches a socket.
//!
//! ── Quick-boot feature parity (OOP seam: shared policy here, per-engine integrations) ──
//!
//! A quick boot is a SET of features. The decision/orchestration is engine-agnostic and
//! lives host-side (this module + the session layer); each feature's *implementation* is
//! owned by the platform-specific integration, because they're different bytecode VMs.
//! Keep this table honest when either engine's quick boot changes:
//!
//!   Feature                 Fraymakers (src/main.rs)             SSF2 (crates/…/abc_inject.rs)
//!   ─────────────────────   ──────────────────────────────────   ──────────────────────────────────
//!   skip menus / title      no-op the final boot load-step        inject_quickboot rewrites the
//!                           (skip Title + ugc load)                initial-menu entry point
//!   preload match assets     bake char + the `s` handler           inject_quickboot queues the
//!                           resolves + fetches stage/assist        char + stage assets up front
//!   loading presentation     the start-match path builds + shows   inject_quickboot shows a loading
//!     (boot → match)         a loading screen (NATIVE; see note)    screen, held until the match starts
//!   readiness signal         READY at boot complete                responsiveness heuristic
//!                                                                   (disclaimer is skipped)
//!   auto-spawn into match    `command(Fraymakers, …)` → `s`         `command(Ssf2, …)` → `spawn`
//!
//! NOTE on FM loading presentation: the start-match path already builds and shows the loading
//! screen on the quick-boot path, but it is not visibly held -- under investigation whether the
//! factory is unset on a fast boot or the screen merely flashes because the `s` handler
//! pre-fetches the match content. SSF2's is held because its on-demand asset decrypt genuinely
//! takes seconds.
