//! session — shared plumbing for the CLI session loops (`peptide session` /
//! `peptide ssf2 session`).
//!
//! The two engines drive commands over different transports (Fraymakers = an async
//! full-duplex socket with a reader thread; SSF2 = synchronous request/response RPC),
//! so their boot/ready halves stay engine-specific — that split is honest, not
//! accidental. What they DO share is the front end of the loop: tailing the session
//! control file and dispatching each newly-appended line. That boilerplate lived twice;
//! it lives here once now.
//!
//! The GUI does not use this — it's event-loop driven over webview IPC, not a control
//! file — which is exactly why the shared surface is the control-file tail and not a
//! grand unified "session" object.
