# Peptide status, known issues, and next steps

where the SSF2 to Fraymakers conversion stands across the roster, plus the live list of
open issues and what's worth doing next. this is the one place we track status and TODOs
for the whole project, so known issues and next steps live here instead of scattered
around. the converter status is up top; the Peptide (engine-harness) feature TODOs are at
the very bottom. if you want to verify any of this yourself,
[`PEPTIDE_GUIDE.md`](PEPTIDE_GUIDE.md) shows you how.

## coverage

**the whole SSF2 roster converts and drives in-engine. nothing's currently broken!**
every character:

- **converts.** the converter exits 0 and produces output, with no hard-conversion failures.
- **drives in-engine.** it spawns in Fraymakers via Peptide, reaches `STAND`, and runs its
  moves without crashing (P0: `LAUNCHED` + `ANIM:STAND` + `M:OK`).
- **has populated entities.** real movesets and hitboxes, checked by
  `tools/tests/parity_check.py` (entity animation counts plus HIT_BOX active-frame
  coverage) so we're not just trusting a shallow spawn signal. hitbox frame-coverage runs
  52-90%+ per character; what's left are projectile specials and throws that have no melee
  box anyway.

a few are hand-verified deep (drive moves + physics + anim): `sandbag` (the reference),
`mario` (the deepest, a full 18-move sweep), `kirby`, `bowser`, `fox`. everybody else is
batch-verified (spawn + jab + special_neutral, no crash).

## stage porting

`peptide ssf2 stage <file.ssf>` converts an SSF2 stage to a playable Fraymakers stage. it
parses the SSF2 placement tree for the floor, soft platforms, death/camera boxes, and
entrance/respawn beacons, rasterizes the stage's art (vector shapes + bitmap backgrounds) into the stage sprite, and emits
the FM `.entity` + manifest + StageStats/Script + `.fraytools`; FrayTools builds + publishes
the `.fra` to the engine's `custom/` dir. all 110 corpus stages convert. battlefield (DAT328)
is live-verified: `spawn sandbag battlefieldssf2` (drive with `FRAY_STAGE=<stage>`) loads the
stage, the fighter stands on the platforms, walks, and falls off the edges into the blast
zone (KO + respawn), no crash. NB: a stage needs visible content to place players (the engine
sizes it from the sprite bounds); the sprite is the SSF2 art (vector shapes + bitmap backgrounds rasterized + composited);
stages with no rasterizable art fall back to a geometry placeholder.

the SSF2 `foreground` plane normally folds behind fighters (it's usually a structure's re-drawn
front face, which would read as a duplicate platform); a `keep_foreground` metadata flag opts a
stage out so a genuine overlay stays in front (bowserscastle's glowing lava sheet over the floor).

the backdrop is emitted the way SSF2 authors it: each animated element (lava bubbles, torches,
embers, podoboos, a spectator) is its own FM layer/animation on its own loop, in back-to-front
draw order, rather than one baked composite. elements are grouped by their SSF2 symbol id; a
static element is one frame, an animated one keeps its loop (run-length-encoded at the 30->60fps
doubling, so a held source frame reads as a pause). a single-element backdrop is one layer, same
as before.

the converted stage carries a clean display name (a per-stage override in
`mappings/stage/metadata.jsonc`, with the SSF2 id title-cased as the fallback) plus a source
series, and records its original SSF2 soundtrack (the `bgm_*` ids
pulled from the stage DAT) in the description. it plays a real FM bgm (the override map's pick
or `default_music`) since the SSF2 audio isn't shipped with FM. the content id is suffixed
`<id>ssf2` so it can't shadow a built-in stage.

auto-detected moving platforms (the `moving`-named SSF2 container, propagated to its collision
child) are kept as static collision at their start position, labelled `(SSF2 moving, static)`
in the entity and surfaced in a warning. the motion itself isn't ported there: SSF2 moving
platforms are bespoke per stage (custom AS3 classes / timeline animation), so reproducing them
is per-stage work like porting a character special.

declared `platforms` in metadata become real FM moving Structures (the engine idiom from the
stage-template): a per-platform grey block animation (an IMAGE sized to the platform + a FLOOR
line segment) and one structure CONTENT per platform that the stage spawns and that moves itself
in its own Script. bowserscastle has three grey standing platforms RE'd from the SSF2 terrain
(two wide ledge-bounded side platforms + the small central `terrainGround` block, at their real
positions and widths, in the SSF2 platform grey), sitting over the lava. the thwomp lands on
them and pushes them down: the shared sink/rise Script polls the stage's custom game objects,
sinks the column the thwomp landed on, holds, then rises back. the thwomp is a custom game object
that falls onto each platform column in turn (each at its own height), damages on landing,
re-arms its hitbox each cycle, then rises and moves to the next column.

stage hazards become Fraymakers custom game objects the stage spawns with a null owner, so each
is neutral and damages everyone. damage and knockback come from the entity's native HIT_BOX
(HitboxStats), and three pieces are load-bearing for that hitbox to connect: a null owner (passes
team-hit validation), `stateTransitionMapOverrides` mapping `PState.ACTIVE` to the hitbox
animation (so an animation actually plays and the collision detector resolves it against the
HitboxStats map), and a content-ref `spriteContent` (a bare id string doesn't load the sprite). a
local state machine plays the active/inactive animations for the on/off pulse, and the hitbox is
re-armed on a cadence (`rehit`) so a lingering fighter keeps taking hits. movement patterns
(oscillate / circle / thwomp-fall) move the whole object. each hazard renders its real rasterized
SSF2 art (the thwomp's stone face, the bumper, the lava) recovered from the placement tree; a
hand-declared hazard borrows the detected sprite of its kind, and only a hazard with no recoverable
art falls back to a translucent placeholder box.

damaging hazards auto-detect from the SSF2 placement tree (lava, acid, thwomps, spikes, bumpers,
tornados, damage zones, podoboos, piranhas) by linkage name. the kind is propagated down from the
named container, leaf shapes of one hazard cluster into a single box, and the result is filtered to
the reachable area inside the blast zone (so a hazard parked off-screen at frame 0 doesn't ship as a
phantom hitbox). a `hazards` list in metadata overrides detection for a stage (full manual control,
e.g. a thwomp whose frame-0 position is parked, or a dynamically-spawned hazard); `no_hazards: true`
suppresses a false positive. dynamically-spawned hazards (cannonballs, arwing lasers, birdo eggs,
holy lances) that don't sit in the static tree are a per-stage follow-up, declared by hand as the
need arises. follow-ups: the moving-platform motion, dynamically-spawned hazards, per-stage FM-music
mapping, porting the actual SSF2 audio (licensing-permitting).

stage porting is NOT finished. bowserscastle is the deepest port and the working testbed, and
even it has gaps: chunks of the reconstructed stage behavior are still commented out in the
emitted scripts pending verification (SFX calls among them), so the in-game stage is missing
sound effects and whatever else those blocks drive. other complex stages haven't had the same
1:1 treatment yet (each stage's gimmicks are bespoke AS3 that needs its own RE pass; the
machinery here generalizes, the per-stage work doesn't come for free).

## hitbox-stat parity

**every character's hitbox stats match the SSF2 source. no exceptions right now.**
`tools/tests/parity_check.py` checks every hitbox's `damage` / `angle` / `baseKnockback` /
`knockbackGrowth` / `hitstop` / `selfHitstop` / `hitstun` against the SSF2 source (dumped
via `DUMP_PARITY=1`). that covers the hitbox-*stats* slice of functional equivalence.

the real bar for a "done" character is functional equivalence with SSF2, which is a higher
bar than "spawns, animates, doesn't crash." hitbox-stat parity is one piece of it. the open
dimensions below are the rest.

## open parity dimensions

- **frame data (active-frame range).** startup/active/recovery lives in the `.entity`
  collision-box keyframes and animation lengths, not in `HitboxStats.hx`. we check per-char
  coverage (it's what caught the empty shells), but an exact active-frame comparison against
  SSF2 (×2 for the 30→60 fps bump) is its own fiddly harness pass.
- **special-angle sentinels.** SSF2 sentinel angles (`-1`/`-2`/`-3`…) are preserved
  faithfully, we just haven't mapped them to FM's special-angle codes yet. needs the
  SSF2-sentinel → FM-angle table.
- **per-segment hitbox fidelity.** split sub-anims (`jab2`/`jab3`) inherit the base
  attack's hitbox stats for now. that's sound (FM gates a hitbox by the animation's
  collision-box layers, so an inactive inherited box just sits there inert), but the
  damage/KB *values* are an approximation of the real per-hit finisher. getting the true
  per-hit values means pulling hitbox activation frames out of the SSF2 sprite timeline.
- **physics-stat tuning.** movement stats (gravity/fall/walk/jump/weight) are mapped and
  scaled, but the `stats.jsonc :: multipliers` got hand-tuned by eyeballing template
  characters against SSF2 data. `friction`, `shortHopSpeed`, and the ECB head/hip/foot
  positions are hand-tuned constants too, so ground deceleration, short-hop, and hurtbox
  sizing are all approximate. generated `CharacterStats.hx` flags the shaky numbers with
  `/*TODO*/`. dialing the scale factors in for real needs an in-engine SSF2-vs-converted
  comparison (the dummy / measurement path), not a static fix.
- **SSF2-only / no-FM-equivalent inventory.** SSF2 API surface with no Fraymakers
  mapping. Calls get commented out as `[SSF2-only]` (no impact for human play of
  non-item characters); stat fields and events are handled as noted. The
  authoritative per-entry list (with notes + `manual_port`/`no_equivalent`
  category) lives in `mappings/commands.jsonc :: ssf2_only`; runtime tallies land
  in each character's `conversion_log.json :: ssf2_only`. Confirm any entry as
  droppable (like `priority`) or map it as the API surfaces.

  - **mapped this pass (live-verified on zelda/sandbag/ganondorf):** `getMC`→
    `getViewRootContainer()`, `getStanceMC`→`getSprite()` (members read off it may
    differ; flagged inline), `toCrashLand`→`toState(CState.CRASH_BOUNCE)`, `toIdle`→
    `toState(CState.STAND)`, `toFlying`→`toState(CState.HURT_HEAVY)`; `hitTestGround(x,y)`
    →`hitTestStructuresWithLineSegment(new Point(x,y), new Point(x,y), null, null)` with
    the `!= null`/`== null` checks rewritten to `.length > 0`/`== 0` (Array return), the
    options arg dropped, and a TODO on the point→segment approximation; `if (… isForcedCrash …)`
    blocks DELETED (no forced-crash in FM). AS3 global casts the decompiler wrongly
    attached to `self` (so they were null → "Invalid function null"): `self.int`/
    `self.uint`→`Std.int`, `self.Number(x)`→`Std.parseFloat(Std.string(x))` (`Std` is
    in character-script scope, confirmed by a live probe). Stat fields: `hasEffect`→
    `flinch`, `sdiDistance`→`hitstopNudgeMultiplier` (value/6, since SSF2 default is 6),
    `shieldDamage`→`shieldDamageMultiplier: 1` with the old value kept in a TODO.
  - **method calls, `no_equivalent` (57), commented out.** item system (`getItem`,
    `getItems`, `getItemStat`, `pickupItem`, `tossItem`, `toToss`, `removeItem`,
    `generateItem`, `updateItemStats`, `isZDropped`); CPU/AI (`isCPU`, `getCPULevel`,
    `getCPUAction`, `getCPUForcedAction`, `getCPUTarget`, `setCPUAttackQueue`,
    `importCPUControls`, `resetCPUControls`, `isStandby`, `getStandby`); Flash/MovieClip
    (`getMCByLinkageName`, `getHitBox`, `getKirbyHatMC`, `getHUDBackgroundMC`,
    `getHUDForegroundMC`, `killDarkener`); sound-needs-a-clip-handle (`stopSound`,
    `stopSFX`, `stopHoldSound`, `stopListening`); final-smash/kirby/misc
    (`isUsingFinalSmash`, `setFinalSmashMeterCharge`, `getCurrentKirbyPower`,
    `getCurrentMusicInfo`, `getQualitySettings`); other (`addIgnoreObject`,
    `calculateKnockback`, `checkAtkilled`, `clearEffectsOnStateChange`, `endControl`,
    `exportStats`, `getLedges`, `getNearestPath`, `isReversed`, `jumpToContinue`,
    `killAttackboxes`, `removeSelfPlatform`, `replacePalette`, `setAttackEnabled`,
    `setLastUsed`, `shootOutOpponent`, `spawnEnemy`, `stop`, `updateEnemyStats`).
  - **method calls, `manual_port` (26), close FM equivalent needs hand-work.**
    `fireProjectile`→`match.createProjectile`, `unnattachFromGround`→`unattachFromFloor`,
    `swapDepthsWithGrabbedOpponent`→`swapDepths`, `getMetalStatus`→StatusEffect/BodyStatus,
    `setColorFilters`→`setCostumeShader`, `getCharacter`/`getProjectile`→
    `match.getCharacters`/`getProjectiles`, plus `angleControl`, `createSelfPlatform`,
    `forceAttack`, `getAttackBoxStat`, `getAttackStat`, `getCurrentAttackFrame`,
    `getCurrentProjectile`, `getExecTime`, `getHealthBox`, `getLinkageID`, `getMidground`,
    `getNearest`, `getNearestLedge`, `getPlatformBetweenPoints`,
    `hitTestGroundBetweenPoints`, `homeTowardsTarget`, `inUpperLeftWarningBounds`,
    `isEqual`, `setHurtInterrupt`.
  - **hitbox/attack stat fields still with no FM mapping**, surfaced as compile/runtime
    "invalid stat" for per-site fixing: `camShake`, `chargedPriority`, `ignoreChargeDamage`,
    `meteorBounce`, `onlyAffectsGround`. `stackKnockback` is actually a real FM
    `HitboxStatsProps` field (same name) so it passes through fine, not a gap. NB: the
    "Invalid hitbox stat" check fires only when a hitbox is ACTIVE in-engine, so an eval
    `updateHitboxStats(0, {x: 1})` on an inactive box won't surface it; confirm field
    validity against the FM API types.
    - `priority` DROPPED (confirmed unnecessary). `burn`/`shock` `: true` map to FM
      `element` (`ElementType.FIRE`/`ELECTRIC`, live-verified); their `: false` /
      `pitfall: 0` no-element forms are dropped. Still open (carry a value or an
      unconfirmed FM enum, so per-site, not a flag→enum rename): `aura` (no confirmed
      `ElementType.AURA`), `paralysis` (numeric stun duration), `pitfall` > 0 (FM
      `ElementType.BURY` + `bury*` timing fields, not a bare flag).
  - **Flash display-list / timeline methods called on the mapped view objects**
    (`getMC`→`getViewRootContainer()`, `getStanceMC`→`getSprite()`): `swapChildren`
    (35), `removeChild` (48), `addChild` (12), `getChildByName` (14), `getChildAt`/
    `numChildren`, and timeline reads `currentLabel` (37), `currentFrame` (18),
    `gotoAndPlay`. NONE exist in the FraymakersApiTypes (FM rendering/animation is not
    a Flash display list), so they're null at runtime and need per-site porting (e.g.
    z-order via FM layering, timeline reads via the FM animation API). This is the main
    remaining `Invalid function null` source after the AS3-cast fix.
  - **`SSF2Event` types with no confirmed FM equivalent, neutralized** (the line is
    commented so it can't pass a null event): `KO_POINT`, `CHAR_ATTACK_COMPLETE`,
    `CHAR_ATTACK_CHANGED`, `REVERSE`, `REVERSE_HIT`, `CHAR_COUNTER`, `CHAR_METAL_CHANGE`,
    `PROJ_COLLIDE`, `PROJ_DESTROYED`, `PROJ_HURT`, `HOMING_TARGET`, `ENEMY_DESTROYED`,
    `ITEM_TOSSED`, `ITEM_DESTROYED`, `CHAR_SELF_DESTRUCT`, `CHAR_ABSORB`,
    `CHAR_POWER_SHIELD_HIT`, `CHAR_SIZE_CHANGE`, `CHAR_TRANSFORM`, `ATTACK_ENABLED`,
    `GAME_ITEM_CREATED`. (Mapped this pass: `ATTACK_HIT`, `ATTACK_HIT_SHIELD`,
    `GROUND_LEAVE`, `CHAR_SHIELD_HIT`, `CHAR_KO_DEATH`→`CharacterEvent.KNOCK_OUT`.)

## measuring progress

`tools/tests/translation_completeness.sh` counts untranslated markers per character:
`/* ? */` (decompiler couldn't recover an expr/condition/receiver), `[SSF2-only:` (no FM
equivalent), and `TODO` (value punted to a default). lower is better. it's the safe
before/after gate for decompiler/mapping changes, since a real fix should *drop* the marker
count without adding new ones, and the in-engine spawn sweep still has to pass. ten
characters are fully `/* ? */`-clean. the decompiler-quality outliers worth a focused pass
later are `kirby`, `tails`, `rayman`, `pacman`, `goku`/`lucario`, `dedede`, `sonic`,
`yoshi`.

## how parity should be verified going forward

the endgame is a `verify <move>` Peptide command (see
[`PEPTIDE_DESIGN.md`](PEPTIDE_DESIGN.md) roadmap) that drives a move against a dummy and
diffs what actually happens against the SSF2 reference values. we've already got the
hitbox-stat reference in hand. the missing piece is in-engine measurement of emergent
behavior (a dummy opponent plus post-hit readback), and that's the next focused project.

## stage hazard inventory

full audit of all 110 stages: which have scripted actor/hazard classes, what the converter
handles, and what's a declared gap. run via `ssf2_objgraph <stage.ssf> scripts` + the
debug-info pass. corpus conversion: PASS=110 FAIL=0.

**ported** (converter emits a hazard CGO with disasm-sourced stats; none live-verified yet --
boot `FRAY_STAGE=<id> peptide session --char mario,mario` and watch the out.log hit stream for
>= 2 cycles to confirm):

| stage | hazard / actor | converter output |
|---|---|---|
| bowserscastle | Thwomp (6-column fall), BowsersCastleLava (hazard floor), BowsersCastlePlatform (sinking) | multi-anim CGO + hazard_floor + sinking-platform Structure (the one live-verified stage) |
| casinonightzone | CNZBumper, Bumper1_B/T, Bumper2/3 L/R | 4 Bumper hazard CGOs (auto-detected by class name) |
| hyrulecastle64 | HyruleTornado | Tornado hazard CGO (oscillateX) |
| kingdom1 | PiranhaPlant x2 | two static Piranha CGOs at game(74,74)+(670,244) via `game_coords` metadata; disasm stats (w35 h49, damage 5, angle 90, knockback 90, rehit 30). replaced the auto-detect that stacked both at one wrong spot |

**the `game_coords` mechanism.** a metadata `hazards` entry with `"game_coords": true` takes
the raw SSF2 `setX/setY` + `getOwnStats` width/height literals (terrain-local) and runs them
through the stage's static `terrain_off` + `scale`, the same transform as `sink_columns` and
auto-detected actor hazards. use it for any hazard whose position is a static AS3 literal but
isn't in the placement tree. kingdom1 is the worked example.

**unported, with full disasm spec** (the values below are the measured port spec -- the SSF2
key map is `direction`->angle, `power`->baseKnockback, `kbConstant`->knockbackGrowth,
`refreshRate`->rehit x2; frames x2, px x1.3 for FM). each is unported because it's a moving /
flying / projectile-spawning actor whose in-play position needs a live read (placing a static
box at the offscreen spawn would be a wrong-but-plausible value, worse than a gap), OR its
damaging attackBox extent isn't a disasm literal:

| stage | class | spawn (game coords) | stats (from getAttackStats / onHurt) | why not static |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| dreamland | WhispyWind | (168,137) facing right / (88,137) left; cadence FrameTimer(300); lifetime 300f | damage 0, power 11, kbConstant 1, direction 0 (a pure horizontal wind PUSH, not a hitbox); ghost, width/height 0 | the wind attackBox extent (how far the gust reaches) isn't a disasm literal; needs a live read of the forceAttack("wind") box |
| kingdom1 | PowBlockMK | runtime `powCoordinates` (NOT a disasm literal) | onHurt: damage 20, direction 90, power 90, kbConstant 60 (shockwave when the block is hit) | event-triggered (ENEMY_HURT) + runtime position |
| kingdom2 | Birdo | walks in from (-500,98) / (975,98); throw cadence m_spitTimer 20f; stage spawn timer 450f | contact: damage 5, power 46, kbConstant 62, direction -4. egg projectile: damage 1, power 55, kbConstant 5, direction 20, xspeed 8, time_max 300 | walks in from offscreen + throws egg projectiles; both need live position |
| kingdom2 | Pidgit | walks in from (-500,0) / (975,0); oscillation timer 60f; XSPEED 5, YSPEED 30, scale 2x | carries a carpet platform (not a damage hazard) | moving platform, offscreen spawn |
| sectorz | Arwing | flies from (1292,-120); decision timers 80-150f; X_SPEED 3, Y_SPEED 4, Y_ACCEL 1; despawn at y<-400 | fires arwing_laser projectile: damage 16, power 80, kbConstant 50, direction 35, xspeed 26 (refreshRate 10) | flies across; the laser is a projectile |
| sectorz | SectorZLaser | gun at (-83.25,290.85); charge FrameTimer(90), bullet delay 3f | beam: damage 15, power 175, kbConstant 15, direction 175 (+ second box: damage 5, power 125, direction 125) | the beam sweeps; its swept attackBox extent isn't a disasm literal |
| saffroncity | PokeHazards | window at (450,143); spawn cadence FrameTimer(30 x rand(10,20)) | rotates attacks per pokemon: charmander damage 5/power 45/kb 15/dir -4; venusaur damage 14/power 65/kb 30/dir -3; porygon damage 18/power 65/kb 25/dir -4; electrode damage 30/power 50/kb 100/dir 76/burn | the damage depends on which pokemon spawns (rotating); picking one would be invention |
| saffroncity | CharmanderFire | NOT IN DISASM (initialize empty) | w23 h23, damage 3, power 45, kbConstant 7, direction 45, burn | a child projectile of PokeHazards |
| saffroncity | VenusaurLeaf | NOT IN DISASM | w35 h20, damage 3, power 40, kbConstant 70, direction 60, xspeed 25, time_max 20 | a child projectile of PokeHazards |
| peachscastle | BonzaiBill | digs to (181,-54)/(236,-134)/(288,-53), then flies (SPEED 2, dig 0.1); timers 150/30/90f | explode: damage 10, power 70, kbConstant 125, direction -1, burn. cry/idle: damage 5, power 46, kbConstant 62, direction -9 | digs around then flies across (target (236,308)); fully dynamic path |
| racetothefinish | RTTFDamageZoneHandler | 4 segments; positions NOT IN DISASM (runtime regions, default (-3000,-3000)) | zone damage 10 | segment positions are runtime-populated |
| mushroomkingdom3 | koopa0..koopa17 | per-stage timeline | rolling shells | timeline-driven, no getAttackStats class |
| skullfortress | SniperJoe, Batton, Met | per-stage | patrolling enemies + shots | full enemy AI + projectiles |
| yoshisisland | GooniePlatform, RotatingPlatform | per-stage | moving platforms | rotation/path, not a hazard |
| fourside | FoursideSpaceship | per-stage | UFO moving platform + beam | moving platform + beam |
| junglehijinx | JungleHijinxBarrel | per-stage | barrel cannon (a launcher, not damage) | out of hazard scope |
| pacmaze | EdgeWrap | n/a | screen-wrap behavior | no FM edge-wrap primitive |

to finish any of these: boot SSF2 on the stage (`PEPTIDE_SSF2_STAGE=<id> peptide ssf2 session
--char mario`), `tree 3` to read the live in-play position of the actor / its attackBox, then
add a `game_coords` (or FM-coord) `hazards` entry with the spec above + the measured position,
and live-verify in FM. the stats are already extracted; only the live position is missing.

**weather / ambient effects** (visual only; no hitbox output needed, but missing from
converted stages makes them look flat compared to SSF2):

| class | stages | what it adds |
|---|---|---|
| EmberWeather | bowserscastle | rising fire embers (camera-space, 50 particles, 6x6px, 2px/frame rise at 30fps) -- measured but unported |
| RainWeather | clocktown, crateria, finalvalley, smashville | rain particle field |
| SnowWeather | snowpointtemple, waitingroom | snow particle field |
| FairyGladeWeather | fairyglade | firefly sparkle field |
| WaterSplash | fairyglade, gangplankgalleon, lakeofrage, planetnamek | splash vfx on landing near water |

**stage-level special behaviors** (not hazards; structural/gameplay gaps):

- `pacmaze` EdgeWrap: FM has no native edge-wrap API; requires engine-side custom behavior or
  scripted position teleport in the stage Script. gap until FM exposes that primitive.
- moving platforms across every affected stage: the converter marks them `(SSF2 moving, static)`.
  each is a per-stage AS3 class; see PORTING_STAGES.md for the disasm recipe.

## character system gaps

these are per-character behaviors in the "unknown" stream (not in ssf2_only -- they're calls the
converter doesn't classify at all). the ssf2_only universal gaps (item system, getCharacter,
getMetalStatus, etc.) are already covered above in "SSF2-only / no-FM-equivalent inventory".

**most "unknown" calls are NOT broken.** an "unknown" tally counts call SITES of functions the
converter doesn't recognize -- but the author-defined helper functions (`updateAuraPaws`,
`isDarkPit`, `hurtSelf`, etc.) ARE emitted and translated into the character's `Script.hx`, so
the calls resolve. e.g. `function isDarkPit()` is emitted at Pit/Script.hx:389 with a real body
(`return self.getCostumeShader().paletteSwapPA.replacements[76] == 4289855743`). the genuine
work here is decompiler BODY quality, not call mapping. the one confirmed broken body in the
corpus is **pichu `hurtSelf`** -- emitted as `function hurtSelf(arg0) {}` (empty; the SSF2
statements were dropped in decompilation), so pichu's recoil moves never self-damage. fixing it
needs the real SSF2 body recovered (don't fabricate `setDamage(getDamage()+arg0)` from the name).
the only intentional empties are `inputUpdateHook` + `handleLinkFrames` (template stubs on all 49).

all 49 characters (47 SSF files, incl. multi-char bowser/wario/zelda) convert exit 0.
corpus sweep: PASS=49 FAIL=0. the numbers below are aggregate call counts from
`conversion_log.json :: unknown`.

**per-character unported systems:**

| char | unknown call | count | what it is | port path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| lucario | updateAuraPaws | 507 | aura system: scales damage+KB with lucario's own % damage; the "paws" are visual rings | FM has no built-in % scaling; needs a Script.hx hook on each hit to read `getSelfDamage()` and call `updateHitboxStats` |
| goku | resetKaioKenBackEffect | 66 | kaioken VFX cleanup (resets a back-glow MC) | FM no analog; port as createVfx remove call when it surfaces |
| goku | applyDamageMod | 62 | kaioken damage multiplier (scales outgoing damage while powered up) | same hook as lucario aura; read a "power level" state var, multiply via `updateHitboxStats` |
| pit | isDarkPit | 167 | checks whether the current costume is dark pit (different specials) | FM costume index: `getCostumeIndex()` returns the palette slot; check `== 1` for dark pit costume |
| sonic | getFeetFrames | 94 | detects which frames have feet on the ground for step-sfx triggering | port as animation-label checks in the Script.hx; play step SFX on the identified frames |
| waluigi | tweenRotation | 68 | smooth rotation tween between angles on waluigi's spinning moves | FM: `setRotation()` works in hscript; implement linear tween in Script.hx update loop |
| pacman | applyColourTo | 45 | changes pacman's hue to match the ghost he's become (red/pink/blue/orange) | FM: `setCostumeShader()` can tint; map ghost type to shader params |
| pichu | hurtSelf | 35 | pichu's electric moves deal recoil to himself; called as `hurtSelf(1.5)` (DAir), etc. | CONFIRMED BROKEN: emitted body is empty `{}` (decompiler dropped the SSF2 statements). recover the real body from the SSF2 frame-script def; don't fabricate it |
| kirby | becomeSolid | 34 | kirby stone form: temporarily immune to knockback while transformed | FM `becomeInvulnerable()` or `setHitboxActive(false)` for the immune window; check FM API |
| zelda/sheik | sparkle | 52 | transformation sparkle VFX | port as `createVfx(sparkle_id)` when `sparkle_id` is found in the VFX table |
| isaac/zelda/sheik | cast | 589 | AS3 type-cast expressions the decompiler surfaced as calls; NOT a gameplay call | zero gameplay impact; cosmetic decompiler artifact in the generated code |
| wario/wario_man | clearTimers | 48 | wario-man transformation: resets all active timers on transform in/out | FM timer API: iterate and cancel timers; or just reset state in the transformation trigger |
| (38 chars) | forceGrabbedHurtFrame | 206 | tells the grabbed character to hold a specific hurt frame while being thrown | FM: grabbed characters are set to state `GRABBED`; the frame is driven by the grabber's animation; likely can just drop this call |

| createVfx | 7233 | visual effect spawner; mapped to FM createVfx equivalent; logged as unknown because the VFX id lookup isn't confirmed |
| setAutocancel | 1820 | autocancel window (the frame range an attack can be cancelled into a landing); no confirmed FM equivalent yet |
| activateItem / deactivateItem | 770 / 574 | item grab/drop; part of the item system gap |

## known issues & gaps

the live list of open converter issues. strike an entry when you fix it.

- **shape-only menu portraits.** a few characters (`donkeykong`, `fox`, `marth`) have
  `*_head` portraits built entirely from shapes instead of a bitmap. the head finder grabs
  a Bitmap placement when there is one; when there isn't, the head image comes up empty and
  `Menu.entity` ships a placeholder. wants a small SWF shape rasterizer.

- **mario sprite placement not re-verified.** after the recent rotation / itemBox /
  shear-baking work most characters look right in FrayTools, but mario specifically hasn't
  been re-checked frame by frame. he was the canary that drove the rotation work, so some
  of his animations might still need a focused pass.

- **vector-only effect sprites get skipped silently.** effects whose visuals are pure
  vector shapes with solid-colour fills (some charge sparkles, the F-air twinkle) can't be
  rasterized without a full SWF vector renderer, so only bitmap-backed shapes get exported.

- **frame-script / API translation is incomplete.** `commands.jsonc` handles the bulk of
  SSF2 API calls, and the `ssf2_only` list plus the `conversion_log.json :: unknown` stream
  surface whatever's left. the generated `.hx` always wants a human read.

- **projectile behaviour is stubbed.** projectile *entities* (visuals, boxes, animations,
  palettes) generate fine. projectile *behaviour* (`<Pascal>Script.hx`) is template
  scaffolding with `// TODO: tune X_SPEED / Y_SPEED` placeholders and, for multi-state
  projectiles, empty `LState` transitions.

- **stat scaling is approximate.** see "physics-stat tuning" above. the
  `stats.jsonc :: multipliers` are hand-tuned and the generated `CharacterStats.hx` marks
  the shaky ones with `/*TODO*/`.

- **robustness.** `process_character` swallows per-stage errors and carries on with
  defaults. great for batch runs, but it means a partly-broken character can sneak out
  without an obvious failure. the Tier 1 validation pass catches the most common silent
  regressions (empty stats, empty attacks, declared-vs-extracted mismatch) and writes them
  to `conversion_log.json :: validation_warnings`. always skim `conversion_stats.json` and
  `conversion_log.json` after a run.

- **transformation characters need manual FM-side wiring.** giga bowser and wario man come
  out as standalone packages (`characters/gigabowser/`, `characters/wario_man/`) because
  Fraymakers has no native transformation API. the TODO banner in `CharacterStats.hx` and
  the `ssf2_source` block in `conversion_log.json` both flag it. the content author still
  has to script the swap by hand in the parent character's `Script.hx`.

- **path 2 enumeration fallback is still around.** the fallback in `detect_char_names`
  (instance-method enumeration on Main) is kept as a safety net for a hypothetical future SSF
  that builds its roster array dynamically. a full 47-character corpus sweep never triggers
  the "constructor walk returned empty" warn, so the constructor walk handles the whole known
  roster; the net stays until a shipped release confirms the same in the wild, then it and
  `derive_id_from_getter` can go.

## prioritized next steps

roughly the order a fresh agent should pick these up. the stage and character system gaps
are catalogued in the two new sections above; the items here are the main converter work.

1. **keep the full-corpus sweeps green.** after any parser/emitter change: characters
   (49/49 exit 0), stages (110/110 emitted), and `cargo test --workspace &&
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings`. (currently all green.)

2. **stage hazard keywords: sectorz, saffroncity, peachscastle, dreamland.**
   add `arwing|laser`, `pokehazard|charmander|venusaur`, `banzai|bonzai`, and
   `whispywind|whispy` to `hazard_kind()` in `stage_parser.rs`. all four have the actor
   parsed already (confirmed by debug output: actors listed with class name + x=None means
   they're dynamically spawned so position must come from disasm). for each: disasm
   initialize/update for spawn position, timing, damage, and size; add a metadata entry
   with the measured values; live-verify via phase-7 (boot + watch hit stream).

3. **shape-only head rasterizer.** `donkeykong`, `fox`, `marth` portraits are placeholders.
   add a minimal SWF shape rasterizer (or pull from `ruffle`) for the `*_head` symbol.

4. **verify mario in FrayTools.** re-run mario, scrub frame by frame in FrayTools.

5. **projectile behaviour.** the `<Pascal>Script.hx` stubs need real translated logic from
   the decompiler + JSONC pipeline.

6. **character system gaps (in priority order):**
   a. `setAutocancel` (1820 calls, all 48 chars) -- find the FM equivalent in the API types
      and add a mapping in `commands.jsonc`. this is the highest-count universal unknown.
   b. `pichu` hurtSelf (35 calls) -- simple: disasm pichu per-move self-damage values, add
      a `damageSelf` shim in commands.jsonc mapping to `takeDamage` or direct % write.
   c. `lucario` updateAuraPaws (507 calls) -- aura system needs a Script.hx hook; the
      per-hit damage multiplier read from getSelfDamage() + updateHitboxStats call.
   d. `pit` isDarkPit (167 calls) -- map to `getCostumeIndex() == 1`; add to commands.jsonc.
   e. `waluigi` tweenRotation (68 calls) -- implement a linear tween helper in Script.hx.
   f. `goku` applyDamageMod (62 calls) -- same updateHitboxStats hook as lucario.
   g. `forceGrabbedHurtFrame` (206 calls, 38 chars) -- investigate if the FM grabbed state
      already drives the correct frame; if yes, comment these out as no-ops.

7. **validate stat scaling** against hand-tuned reference characters.

8. **delete the path 2 enumeration fallback** once a shipped release confirms it's unused.

## peptide / harness todos

the live-engine tooling features we want to build. this is the one list (PEPTIDE_DESIGN.md
points here).

1. **multiplayer in quick boot.** 1-4 player matches work on Fraymakers. the `spawn`/fastboot
   vocabulary takes a roster of up to 4 comma-separated characters (`spawn a,b,c,d [stage] [assist]`,
   `FRAY_ROSTER`/config `roster`, `--char a,b,c,d`); the launch builds the full N-player characters
   array and the engine constructs every fighter natively. 1-2 players use training mode (the
   parity-harness "fighter + dummy" path), 3-4 auto-engage versus mode (selected at runtime by roster
   size). each extra is synchronously self-bootstrapped, so DISTINCT custom chars in one roster work
   (`spawn sandbag,mario,sandbag,mario` -> 4 live, verified). every fighter binds to `p0`/`p1`/`p2`/`p3`
   and `match.getCharacters().length` reports the real count (read host-side from the live match, since
   hscript lacks RTTI on the raw character list). verified live: rosters of 1/2/2-distinct/3/4 ->
   `getCharacters()` 2/2/2/3/4, zero crashes, `p3.getStateName()` drivable. `spawn --versus a,b` forces
   versus mode for a 1-2 player roster (wire byte `S`). SSF2 input injection is live too:
   `hold`/`release`/`seq` drive the controlled player via a per-frame applicator injected into
   `Controller.getControlStatus` (host control masks translated to SSF2's control-bit layout),
   verified live (`hold right` walks: XSpeed 0 -> 4 -> 0 on release; `seq jump:…` leaves the
   ground). still open: they don't yet take hits in a verified way. prerequisite for #6. (impl note:
   extras are built as UNROLLED straight-line blocks -- emitting the
   char-resolve helper inside a runtime back-branch corrupts the loop counter, so each of the <=3
   extras is its own guarded block.)
3. **`addCharacter`** -- drop one more fighter into the LIVE match on the fly, **working on both
   engines**. Fraymakers (`addCharacter`, aliases `addchar`/`add`, wire `n`) re-arms the per-frame
   deferred-spawn. SSF2 does a real live add: its per-match player containers are fixed-size at
   `StageData.startGame`, so `spawn` reserves one spare slot (exist=false, null character, capped at
   4) and `addCharacter` fills it -- set the slot's PlayerSetting, importData the stats, then
   construct the Character directly (its ctor self-registers via `addPlayer`/`addCharacter`),
   bracketed by de/activateCharacters like makePlayer, skipping makePlayer's start-game-only
   attachHealthBox. verified live: `addCharacter` on a 1-char match adds a real drivable `sandbag`
   (count 1->2, walks under input, match stable). note: the added fighter can bind to a different
   `pN` slot than expected. open on FM: the deferred add hasn't been re-verified against a
   versus-mode match for slots past the initial roster.
4. **scenario replay test env.** the `scenario` command sets up a deterministic, re-runnable
   scene: `scenario <p0 x,y[,vx,vy]> <p1 x,y[,vx,vy]> [<ctrl:frames>…]` places both players at
   fixed positions (optionally with world-space momentum), resets them to neutral STAND, then
   plays an input timeline on p0. re-run the exact line to replay it. host-side macro composing
   `eval` + `seq` through the DebugTarget seam, working on **both engines** (verified live on SSF2:
   the setup lowers `setX`/`setY`/`setXVelocity` to field writes and `toState(CState.STAND)` to
   `setState(0)`, then the input timeline plays via the SSF2 input applicator). still open: setting
   a precise animation FRAME (not just the state) and the hit-measurement readback (#6) that makes
   a scenario's outcome quantifiable.
5. **live move-tuning** -- the `tune <player> <hitbox> <stat>=<value> …` command hot-reloads a
   move's hitbox stats into the running match with no relaunch, **working on both engines**.
   Fraymakers addresses a hitbox by INDEX (`tune p0 0 damage=15 baseKnockback=50 angle=45`) via the
   engine's `updateHitboxStats`. SSF2 addresses by MOVE NAME (its attacks are move-name keyed):
   `tune p0 a damage=15 angle=45` mutates the `a` move's stored `AttackBoxes["attackBox"]` (an
   AttackDamage with public setters) via the TUNE verb -- `AttackDataObj()` (protected getter,
   reused QName) -> `getAttack(move)` -> the box -> set Damage/KBConstant/Power/Direction, read back
   as confirmation. mutating the stored box persists (it's re-imported each hit). move keys are the
   raw SSF2 attack names (`a`, `a_forward_tilt`, `special`, …). verified live: `tune p0 a damage=77`
   -> box0 Damage=77; `tune p0 a_forward_tilt damage=33 angle=200` -> Damage=33, Direction=200.
   still open: the UI surface, tweaking move *code* (not just stats) on the fly, persisting tweaks
   back to source, and tuning boxes past box 0 / by frame.
6. **in-engine hit measurement** (needs #1): hit-result readback (damage dealt, knockback
   distance + angle, hitstun frames), KO-threshold search (binary-search the dummy's % for
   the lowest KO), and an active-box dump (every active hit/hurt box this frame). damage
   readback already works live: `scenario 0,0 20,0` (dummy overlapping) + `seq attack:3`
   (drive the attack via INPUT, not `toState`) + reading `p1.damage._damage` shows the dummy
   take the hit (0 → 9 on a sandbag jab). so the `toState(JAB)` "doesn't arm a hitbox" confound
   is bypassed by input-driving the attack. still open: knockback/hitstun readback, the
   KO-search, the active-box dump, and two position confounds: `p0.flipX()` returns 0 not a
   facing sign, and `getX` carries an offset from `setX` (`setX(0)` reads back `getX -19.5`).
7. **frame-advantage display** in the Peptide UI, on shield hit and on hit.
8. **overlay mode.** `$PEPTIDE_OVERLAY=1` floats the console ON TOP of the running game:
   always-on-top, compact (440x560), parked top-right of the primary monitor, with the full UI
   (matching our theming). F8 toggles always-on-top on/off live so you can pop it over the match
   and drop it back without relaunching. still open: true window transparency (the system webview
   makes this fiddly per-OS) and auto re-fit when the game window moves/resizes (needs OS window
   tracking).
9. **batch commands / inputs from a file** -- the UI half. the CLI half is `peptide tell
   --file <path>` (one command per line, `#` comments skipped; mixes engine cmds, `e`
   hscript, and `seq`/`hold` inputs through the one dispatch path).
10. **way more hscript commands.** convenience commands wrap common eval patterns through the
    one dispatch path: `scenario` (#4), `tune` (#5), `dmg <player> <value>` (set damage percent),
    `info` (one-shot readout of both players' x / state / damage / team), `reset` (neutral state +
    zero momentum), and `kill <player>` (force a KO into the bottom blast zone). all validated +
    unit-tested. more can be added the same way (a `Cmd` registry entry + a `parse_*` that returns
    `Command::Eval`).
11. **SSF2 command parity.** the SSF2 backend lowers the same command vocabulary to reflection
    verbs, so the host-side eval macros work there too. `dmg`/`info`/`reset`/`kill` are verified
    live on SSF2 (the evaluator handles a `;`-joined multi-statement line, an `[…]` array literal,
    the `damage._damage` getter/setter idiom, position/velocity setters as property writes, and
    `toState(neutral)` as the SSF2 state setter); `console` declares its gap (SSF2 has no debug
    console). `dmg`/`info`/`kill` are verified on Fraymakers too. input injection
    (`hold`/`release`/`seq`, `scenario`'s timeline), `addCharacter`, and `tune` all work on SSF2
    now (see #1/#3/#4/#5). parity is NOT closed out; still open:
    - **the `status` feed on SSF2** isn't working 100% yet (the matchStatus readout the GUI
      widgets consume), so the command set is close but not at parity.
    - **`reset` on Fraymakers** trips a script error (one of its setters / `toState` resolves to
      null on the FM character); the SSF2 path is unaffected. pre-existing, unrelated to the SSF2
      parity work, worth a separate look.
