# contributing

a working agreement for keeping the code, tests, and docs in sync as the project grows.
the intent is light-touch: small habits that catch the routine drift, no bureaucratic
gates.

## copyright boundary (read first)

SSF2 (© McLeodGaming) and Fraymakers / FrayTools (© Team Fray) are proprietary.
**never commit or publish their source, bytecode, decompiled output, disassembly, stack
traces, assets, or extracted strings** -- not in code, not in docs, not in commit
messages. reverse-engineering notes are fine **in our own words** for interoperability, so
paraphrase, never paste. full policy is in [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) "Reverse-engineering &
copyright boundary". the git-ignored `docs/` scratch folder is still subject to all of
this, it's just not where durable notes belong (see "the `docs/` folder" below).

**special case -- the Fraymakers engine.** to respect Team Fray's wishes, two
things stay out of the tracked repo: (1) how to **decompile or patch** the
Fraymakers engine or the FrayTools bundle, and (2) **specific non-hscript engine class /
function / field names** or the engine's internal symbol map. that's the one category of
RE notes that never gets promoted into a durable doc. it stays local-only in the gitignored
`docs/` scratch space. it's totally **fine** to document what Peptide does and how to
contribute to it (the patcher architecture, resolve-by-name, the `doctor` workflow, where
handlers go) and to use the public hscript scripting API. the SSF2 / SWF / ABC input-side
format notes aren't affected. this also reaches **code comments**: a `.rs` comment must not
name an engine class/function/field or cite an engine code line (`name@12345`) -- the symbol
map lives only in the patcher source (`manifest.rs`, `connect_edit`, the RE bins). details:
[`AGENT_CONTEXT.md`](AGENT_CONTEXT.md) "engine-side knowledge is not in this repo".

## quick checklist (do before opening a PR / pushing a branch)

a few questions, in order:

1. **did you change `src/**` or `crates/**`?**
   run `cargo test --release`. the `golden_sandbag` snapshot is the main safety net, so if
   its hashes change you've changed character output and the golden needs an explicit update
   (`crates/ssf2-converter/tests/golden/sandbag_hashes.txt`).

2. **did you touch one of the "hot files" below?**
   check the doc section listed next to it. if the change shifts the description, update the
   doc in the same commit.

3. **did you add or rename anything user-facing?**
   - new CLI flag? update DEVELOPMENT §3.3 (and the README quick-start if basic usage changes).
   - new `conversion_log.json` field? update DEVELOPMENT §4 step [11].
   - new diagnostic binary? add a row in DEVELOPMENT §5.7.
   - new mapping JSONC section? update DEVELOPMENT §6.

4. **did you add a host-facing debug command or feature?**
   it has to work **identically on both engines** (Fraymakers + SSF2). define it once
   through the shared seam: a `DebugTarget` trait method (default = `eval`) plus the engine
   helper in `commands.hsx` AND `src/ssf2_target.rs`, never an `if engine == …` branch in
   command/feature logic. full rule in [`AGENT_CONTEXT.md`](AGENT_CONTEXT.md) "ONE command
   vocabulary, TWO engines".

that's it! the rest is just tooling that backs the checklist (see "tooling" below).

## hot file → doc-section map

when you change one of these, skim the listed doc section in the same commit. if the change
is big enough to need a doc edit, the linked section is where it goes.

the converter source is the `crates/ssf2-converter/` library; Peptide (live-engine harness,
webview UI, engine driver) is the root `src/`.

| Hot file | Affected doc sections |
|---|---|
| `crates/ssf2-converter/src/convert.rs` (orchestration: `detect_char_names`, `process_character`, `write_conversion_log`, `run_conversion`) | DEVELOPMENT §3.3, §4, §5.1 |
| `src/convert.rs` (peptide `convert` CLI adapter) | DEVELOPMENT §3.3 |
| `crates/ssf2-converter/src/extractor.rs` (`CharacterData` struct) | DEVELOPMENT §5.4 |
| `crates/ssf2-converter/src/abc_parser.rs` (Stage A bundle extraction, constructor walker, normalStats_id) | DEVELOPMENT §5.3 |
| `crates/ssf2-converter/src/decompiler.rs` | DEVELOPMENT §5.3 |
| `crates/ssf2-converter/src/sprite_parser.rs` (box geometry, xframe transforms) | DEVELOPMENT §5.4; AGENT_CONTEXT §"Collision Boxes" |
| `crates/ssf2-converter/src/image_extractor.rs` (PNG / placement / skew bake / projectile-and-head discovery) | DEVELOPMENT §5.4; AGENT_CONTEXT §"Image Sprites" |

| `crates/ssf2-converter/src/uuid_gen.rs` | DEVELOPMENT §5.6; AGENT_CONTEXT §"Top-Level Structure" if GUID seeding changes |
| Peptide root `src/` (gui.rs, peptide_ui.html, config.rs, platform.rs, manifest.rs, fraytools.rs) | docs/PEPTIDE_DESIGN.md; docs/PEPTIDE_GUIDE.md; TESTING.md |
| `crates/ssf2-converter/mappings/commands.jsonc` | DEVELOPMENT §6.1 |
| `crates/ssf2-converter/mappings/character/*.jsonc` | DEVELOPMENT §6.2–§6.4 |
| `src/bin/*` | DEVELOPMENT §5.7 (add a row to the table) |
| `tests/*` | Update coverage/status in `docs/STATUS.md` if the change is significant |

## when you delete code

deletion is the doc-drift case the tests have the hardest time catching. the convention:

- **removed a function?** grep the repo for references first:
  `git grep -n <fn_name> -- '*.md' '*.rs'`. update any doc hits.
- **removed a flag / mapping / output field?** same drill. watch out for the `*` substring
  matches especially, e.g. removing `extract_costume_*` meant grepping for any
  `extract_costume_*` reference.
- **removed a "known issue" because you fixed it?** strike its entry in `docs/STATUS.md`
  (both the "known issues & gaps" list and the matching "prioritized next steps" item).

## when you fix a "known issue"

known issues, the code-quality backlog, and prioritized next steps all live in
**`docs/STATUS.md`** (the single home for converter status and TODOs). when you fix
something, strike its entry in the "known issues & gaps" list there, plus the matching
"prioritized next steps" / "code-quality backlog" item.

## tooling

we don't gate on docs. we do have two light checks:

- **`tests/doc_freshness.rs`** -- two guards. `no_stale_terms_in_top_level_docs` flags
  known-stale terms (references to deleted functions, a detection paradigm we replaced,
  etc.); add a pattern whenever you remove something user-visible.
  `no_engine_internals_in_tracked_docs` is the **compliance trip-wire**, and it fails if any
  tracked doc names a Fraymakers/FrayTools engine-internal symbol (see the "special case"
  above). keep those names in the gitignored `docs/` scratch space only. both run in
  `cargo test`.
- **`tests/conventions.rs :: no_engine_internals_in_code_comments`** -- the same compliance
  trip-wire for `.rs` comments: it fails if a comment names a Fraymakers/FrayTools engine
  symbol or cites an engine code line (`name@12345`), outside the patcher source that is the
  symbol map's home (`manifest.rs`, `connect_edit` in `main.rs`, the `src/bin/` RE tools).
- **`tests/constructor_walk_detection.rs :: corpus_constructor_walk_matches_path2_enumeration`**
  -- guards the detection invariant (constructor walk and the fallback enumeration agree
  across the corpus). don't bypass this; fix the underlying divergence.

no pre-commit / pre-push hooks. they add friction for a one-person / small-team flow and
miss the real failure mode anyway (someone confidently breaking a doc reference). the test
suite + the checklist are the gates.

## commit hygiene

- one logical change per commit. big mixes (`fix X + refactor Y`) make doc drift harder to
  spot, so split them.
- the commit message body explains the *why* and lists files-changed by intent group. see
  `git log` for recent examples.
- when the change touches docs, mention the section in the message: "DEVELOPMENT §5.3:
  updated abc_parser description." future you will grep for it.

## architectural rationale

the *why* behind major design decisions (the path 1 → path 2 stat-extraction switch, the
constructor-walk detection, the multi-character project layout) lives in `git log` / commit
messages, not in a dedicated doc section. when you land a substantial design change, explain
the *why* in the commit message. keep the durable, current-state docs at the repo top level
(README / DEVELOPMENT / AGENT_CONTEXT / TESTING / CONTRIBUTING / NOTICE) plus the Peptide
docs in `docs/`, and don't let development history pile up in them.

## the `docs/` folder

`docs/` holds the **tracked** Peptide harness docs -- `PEPTIDE_GUIDE.md`,
`PEPTIDE_DESIGN.md`, `STATUS.md` (re-included via `.gitignore` negations) -- and is
otherwise a **gitignored scratch space** for working notes during a task (investigation
logs, RE findings mid-flight, throwaway plans).

the rule: **if a scratch note would help anyone else** (a fact, a gotcha, an RE finding, a
design decision, a "what's still open") **promote it into the relevant durable doc** (a
top-level doc, or one of the three `docs/` files), then delete the scratch note. don't let
durable knowledge live only in untracked scratch, because the next person (or agent) cloning
the repo never sees it.

**the one exception:** Fraymakers engine and FrayTools RE notes (see the "special
case" under copyright boundary above) are **never** promoted. they stay in the gitignored
scratch space permanently. `docs/ENGINE_INTERNALS.local.md` is the seed for that material,
so extend it locally and never move it into a tracked file.
