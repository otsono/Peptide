# Peptide -- SSF2 / Fraymakers format reference (agent context)

this doc is the authoritative reference for AI agents on this codebase. both SSF2's SWF
format and Fraymakers' entity format are largely undocumented, so everything here was
reverse-engineered from first principles during development.

> **Copyright boundary -- do not paste, do not publish.** SSF2 (© McLeodGaming)

> **architecture convention -- minimum bytecode, maximum hscript (read before every commit).**
> hand-emitted engine bytecode in `src/main.rs` (`connect_edit` and its `inject_*`

> much of the behaviour as you can in `commands.hsx`.** bytecode is allowed -- just keep
> it to the irreducible engine-side primitive that hscript/host can't otherwise reach.
> where each kind of logic belongs:
> - **`commands.hsx` (hscript in the engine's own interpreter via the `e` hook) -- the
>   DEFAULT for engine-side behaviour.** anything you can express by calling the script
>   API or the bound values (p0/match/CState/…) goes here, not in bytecode.
> - **`src/interpreter.rs` (host-side Rust, runs in the Peptide process)** for anything
>   Peptide can do itself: translating commands, parsing `error.log`, building diagnostics,
>   routing TCP channels, reading character files. no engine round-trip needed → host-side.
> - **bytecode (`connect_edit`/`inject_*`) -- only the minimum primitive** hscript/host
>   can't reach: the socket bootstrap, per-frame dispatch, the command hooks, or binding a
>   value into the eval scope. push everything ELSE up into hscript.
>
> before adding to `connect_edit`/`inject_*`, ask: is this the *smallest* engine primitive
> that unblocks the feature, with the rest done in `commands.hsx` / `interpreter.rs`? (do
> NOT document the specific engine class/function/field names you patch against -- see
> "engine-side knowledge is not in this repo" below.)

> **architecture convention -- ONE command vocabulary, TWO engines (read before adding any
> host-facing feature).** Peptide debugs both Fraymakers and SSF2. a command or feature must
> behave **identically** on both -- the user types the same thing and it does the equivalent
> thing regardless of which engine is attached. this is enforced by a layered OOP seam;
> respect the layer boundaries:
> - **`src/interpreter.rs` -- the engine-agnostic vocabulary.** `parse()` turns a typed line
>   into a `Command`; `src/vocab.rs` declares the `commands.hsx` vocabulary + the FM↔SSF2
>   name reconciliation. new command syntax is defined **here, once**, never per-engine.
> - **`src/debug_target.rs` -- the `DebugTarget` trait (the feature surface).** every
>   host-facing feature is a trait method. give it a DEFAULT that just evaluates the engine
>   helper of the same name (`match_status()` → `eval("matchStatus()")`, etc.). both backends
>   implement `eval`, so a new feature reaches **both** engines the moment each engine's eval
>   knows the expression -- Fraymakers via `commands.hsx`, SSF2 via `src/ssf2_target.rs`. an
>   engine that genuinely can't do a feature *overrides the method to say so* (e.g. SSF2
>   `char_icon` → `None`); it doesn't get silently special-cased in the caller.
> - **backends (`FraymakersTarget`, `Ssf2Target`) + the transport** are the ONLY place
>   engine differences live. everything above them is shared.
> - **passive host features (a stream the engine emits, or a display) are shared the same
>   way.** the live debugger overlay (`src/overlay.rs`) is engine-agnostic: it tails the
>   session `out.log` and renders it, and BOTH the Fraymakers (`bridge`) and SSF2
>   (`ssf2_bridge`) sessions spawn it through the one `overlay::spawn_for_session`. anything
>   the engine *surfaces into that log* is the per-engine half: surfacing trapped script
>   errors as a `SCRIPTERR:` line is the FM engine's job (done by the bytecode patch); SSF2
>   surfaces its own errors through its bridge. the overlay just shows whichever arrives. so
>   the feature ("see errors + state over the game") is one host feature on both engines; only
>   *how each engine produces the data* differs, and an engine that can't produce some of it is
>   a capability gap (an empty field), not a special case in the host.
>
> THE RULE: **never write `if engine == fraymakers { … } else { … }` in feature/command logic.**
> if you reach for that, the difference belongs lower down -- in `vocab.rs`, a trait-method
> override, or the transport. the GUI's per-engine branching is limited to the transport
> shell (which socket to talk to); the moment it creeps into *what a command does*, you've
> broken the contract. a new feature should be: add a `DebugTarget` method (default = eval) +
> implement the expression in `commands.hsx` AND `ssf2_target` -- then it "just works" on both!
> see [`docs/PEPTIDE_DESIGN.md`](docs/PEPTIDE_DESIGN.md) for the full seam.

cross-reference: [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md) covers build / pipeline / modules and
the current set of mapping JSONC files; this file covers the **input** and **output**
formats themselves.

## reference resources

always check these before guessing about either format:
- **Fraymakers API docs** (community-run, high utility -- start here for any
  question about engine functions/scripts/classes): https://shifterbit.github.io/fraymakers-api-docs/
- **Fraymakers character template** (official): https://github.com/Fraymakers/character-template
- **SSF2 modding docs**: https://ssf2-modding.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html

the character template's `library/entities/character.entity` is the ground truth for entity format.
it's a 2.67 MB file -- parse it programmatically with `curl | python3`, not web_fetch (truncates).

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fraymakers/character-template/main/library/entities/character.entity | python3 -c "
import sys, json; obj = json.load(sys.stdin)
# inspect layers, keyframes, symbols as needed
"
```

## what this tool does

converts Super Smash Flash 2 (SSF2) character `.ssf` files into Fraymakers character packages
compatible with FrayTools. it extracts:
- bitmap images (PNG sprites per frame)
- collision box data (hitboxes, hurtboxes, grab/ledge/reflect/absorb boxes) per animation frame
- frame scripts (decompiled from ABC bytecode and rewritten through the JSONC command table)
- sound references (WAV via `ffmpeg`)
- palette / costume data (15 costumes per character from `misc.ssf`)
- projectile and effect sprites as standalone `.entity` files
- a menu / portrait entity for the character-select screen

output is a FrayTools character package directory (full layout in [`README.md`](README.md) and
[`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md) §7).

## SSF2 (.ssf) file format

`.ssf` files are SSF-wrapped SWF files. the unwrapper lives in `src/ssf.rs`:

- a `.ssf` is either a raw SWF (`FWS` / `CWS` / `ZWS` magic -- passed through), or
- an SSF-wrapped file: `u32 swf_len` + `u32 garbage_header_size` + zlib payload.

after unwrapping, `swf_parser::parse` uses the Ruffle `swf` crate (`decompress_swf` +
`parse_swf`) to turn the bytes into a tag tree.

### SWF structure for SSF2 characters

```
SymbolClass        → maps char_id (u16) → class name string
DefineBitsLossless → raw bitmap data (palette / RGBA / ARGB)
DefineBitsJpeg3    → JPEG image data (with optional zlib alpha mask)
DefineShape        → shape with a bitmap fill (wraps a DefineBits*)
DefineSprite       → animation timeline (PlaceObject/ShowFrame/RemoveObject tags)
DoABC / DoABC2     → AS3 bytecode blocks (the character's logic + stats + costume tables)
DefineSound        → audio (Nellymoser, MP3, ADPCM)
```

### animation sprites

each character animation lives in a named `DefineSprite`:
- name format: `{char}_fla.{AnimLabel}_{index}` e.g. `mario_fla.FAir_42`
- the root MC (main timeline) places these sprites at specific frame labels (`stance` placements)
- each animation sprite contains a sequence of PlaceObject/ShowFrame/RemoveObject tags

the character's main timeline (root) is a DefineSprite whose `SymbolClass` name matches
the character id exactly (e.g. `mario`, `fox`). frame labels on the root MC drive the
`xframe` map: SSF2 frame methods assign an animation label to an `xframe` field, recovered
by the extractor from the ABC bytecode.

### root MC transform

every animation sprite is placed by the root MC with a transform:
```
tx, ty  = world offset of the character origin (typically negative, e.g. -24.70, -55.30)
sx, sy  = character scale (typically 1.1 for Mario)
```
all child positions must be composed through this transform via the full affine matrix
(a, b, c, d, tx, ty) -- translation × scale alone won't do it, since some root placements rotate.
see `sprite_parser::XframeTransform` and `image_extractor::ImageLocalMatrix`.

### SWF matrix decomposition

SWF PlaceObject matrices use `Fixed16` (fixed-point) values:
```
a, b, c, d = matrix components (b and c carry shear/rotation)
tx, ty     = translation in TWIPS (divide by 20 to get pixels)
```

decompose into scale/rotation:
```rust
scale_x = sqrt(a² + b²)
scale_y = sqrt(c² + d²)
// Flip detection: encode the sign in scale_y when the determinant is negative.
let det = a*d - b*c;
let sy  = if det < 0.0 { -scale_y } else { scale_y };
rotation_deg = atan2(b, a).to_degrees()
```

### rotation convention -- both SWF and FrayTools are CW-positive

SWF's `atan2(b, a)` in y-down screen space and FrayTools' rotation field use the
**same CW-positive convention**. **don't negate.** the converter emits rotation
values normalized to the `[0, 360)` range:

```rust
rotation: round2(((swf_rotation % 360.0) + 360.0) % 360.0)
```

this applies to **both** IMAGE symbols and COLLISION_BOX symbols. the
`((swf_rotation % 360.0) + 360.0) % 360.0` formula is the source of truth.

### skew handling

FrayTools' IMAGE keyframe can express translation + rotation + scaleX + scaleY, but
**not shear**. when a SWF placement matrix has shear (non-perpendicular x/y column
vectors, detected via `ImageLocalMatrix::has_skew()`), `image_extractor::prerender_skewed_frames`
bakes the world-space linear part into a fresh PNG and rewrites the placement as a plain
translation. non-sheared placements (pure rotation + scale + flip) take the faithful
scale+rotation path.

### collision boxes

SSF2 encodes ALL collision-box data in the SWF timeline, not in AS3 code.

the collision-box character (typically `CollisonBox_6` -- note SSF2's internal typo
"Collison") is a small square shape (~100×100 unit, scaled per instance by the
PlaceObject matrix). `sprite_parser::find_collision_box_base_size` measures the
shape's true bounds at runtime (not hardcoded):
```
width   = |scale_x| * BASE_SIZE
height  = |scale_y| * BASE_SIZE
center_x = tx_pixels   (tx/ty ARE the centre, not top-left)
top_left_x = center_x - width/2
top_left_y = center_y - height/2
```

#### box instance names → BoxType

the SSF2 instance name on the PlaceObject determines the FM box type. see
`sprite_parser::BoxType::from_instance_name` and `entity_gen::box_type_to_fm`:

| SSF2 instance name | Fraymakers type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `attackBox`, `attackBox2`… | `HIT_BOX` | Active hitbox |
| `hitBox`, `hitBox2`… | `HURT_BOX` | Hurtbox (SSF2 "hit" = FM "hurt") |
| `hurtBox` | `HURT_BOX` | Hurtbox (alternate name) |
| `grabBox` | `GRAB_BOX` | Grab range |
| `itemBox` | `HURT_BOX` | Item pickup -- no native FM equivalent; emitted as hurtbox |
| `touchBox` | `GRAB_HOLD_POINT` | **POINT layer** (not COLLISION_BOX) |
| `shieldBox` | `REFLECT_BOX` | |
| `reflectBox` | `REFLECT_BOX` | |
| `absorbBox` | `COUNTER_BOX` | |
| `ledgeBox` / `ledgegrabbox` | `LEDGE_GRAB_BOX` | |
| anything else `*box` | `HURT_BOX` | Fallback |

**`touchBox` → grabholdpoint (verified):**
- layer type is `POINT`, not `COLLISION_BOX`.
- layer name is `grabholdpoint<N>`.
- `pluginMetadata["com.fraymakers.FraymakersMetadata"]` uses `pointType: "GRAB_HOLD_POINT"`.
- symbol is type `POINT` with just `x` / `y` / `alpha` / `color` / `rotation` (bottom-centre
  of the touchBox area -- where the opponent's feet anchor).
- verified against the official Fraymakers character template `grab_hold` animation.

#### itemBox special case

`itemBox` (typically id=991) is placed relative to the **hand attachment point**
(bottom-centre of the box). the PlaceObject tx/ty is the hand position; the inner
shape geometry hangs upward from it (inner_w ≈ 3.7, inner_h ≈ 21.9 pixels). the
emitted COLLISION_BOX symbol uses `pivotY = height` (instead of `height / 2`) so
rotation pivots around the hand. `itemBox` is the only routinely rotated collision
box, so the pivot-at-bottom convention matters here.

### SSF2 stage structure

a stage `.ssf` is a SWF whose document root places two things: the `<id>_bg` backdrop
container (linkage `<id>_bg`, no instance name) and the `stageMC` (linkage `stage_<id>`).
the AS3 `stage_<id>` class exposes the stage to the engine via named slots, and the placement
uses those same INSTANCE names. identify layers by instance name + linkage id + the AS3
slots, NOT by the fla-prefixed timeline symbol names (`<id>_fla.<thing>_<n>`), which are
auto-generated and don't generalize.

the planes (stage-root child instance names = AS3 slots), back to front:

| instance name | role | maps to |
|---|---|---|
| `<id>_bg` (linkage, unnamed) | painted backdrop, fixed (moves 1:1 with the world) | FM background IMAGE |
| `*_cambg` (inside `<id>_bg`) | camera-relative parallax layers (`getCameraBackgrounds`) | FM camera background |
| `background` | fixed backdrop plane | FM background IMAGE |
| `terrain` | collision masks (invisible in SSF2) | FM collision boxes / line segments |
| `foreground` / `*_fg` | draws in front of fighters | FM foreground IMAGE |
| `shadowMask` / `reflectionMask` | masks (not art) | dropped |
| `stance` | spawn-pose beacons | dropped (spawns come from the markers below) |

markers live inside `terrain`, identified by LINKAGE suffix (no instance name): `*TerrainMC*`
(solid floor), `terrainGround_platform*` (drop-through), `CollisonBox*` [sic], `ledge_mc_*`,
`pN_Start` / `pN_Spawn` (spawns), `boundary_clip` / `deathBoundary` / `camBoundary`,
`warningbounds_*`, `itemGen_mc`.

the `SSF2Stage` AS3 class (visible in any stage's ABC via `ssf2_objgraph <stage.ssf> slots
SSF2Stage`) confirms the model: `getBackground` / `getMidground` / `getForeground` are the
fixed planes; `getCameraBackgrounds` is the separate parallax system. parallax is rare (1 of
110 corpus stages, junglehijinx); the rest have a single fixed backdrop.

### image sprites

each animation's visual content sits inside its DefineSprite as a stack of `PlaceObject`
tags placing one or more named `DefineSprite`s (the sub-sprites) or unnamed effect
sprites. `image_extractor::build_anim_frame_images` walks each animation's display list
and records, per frame, every placed image with its full world-space affine matrix
(`FrameImageEntry`).

#### effect sprites

some animations contain nested effect movieclips (e.g. `mario_fla.ChargeSpark_25`):
`_fla.`-named sub-sprites that aren't top-level animation containers. the image
extractor flattens them -- composes each effect frame's content into the parent
timeline via matrix multiplication (`ImageLocalMatrix::compose`).

pure-vector effect shapes (solid-colour fills, no bitmap) **cannot be rendered**
without a full SWF vector rasterizer, so they're silently skipped -- only bitmap-backed
shapes are exported. affected examples include some sparkle / charge effects.

#### shape_to_bitmap map

`DefineShape` tags may have multiple fill entries:
1. `id = 65535` -- the SWF null / clipping bitmap (**always skip**).
2. the real bitmap id.

the extractor takes the first non-65535 bitmap fill. `image_extractor::shape_pivot`
captures where the shape's local (0,0) lands inside its bitmap (from the fill matrix
`tx / (a/20)`, `ty / (d/20)`); this drives image-placement pivot offsets in the
emitted entity.

#### unnamed sprites

some sub-sprites and shapes have no `SymbolClass` entry; those are resolved via the
display list (their inner content placed in by depth/timeline). they get synthetic
`id_NNNN` names internally and are stripped from the final entity output if they carry
no real image content.

## Fraymakers entity format (.entity)

the `.entity` file is a JSON document consumed by FrayTools, the core of a character
package. all GUIDs are deterministic -- seeded by `{char_id}::{context}` and run through
UUID v5 (SHA-1 namespace) in `src/uuid_gen.rs`.

### top-level structure

```json
{
  "animations": [...],        // per-animation objects
  "export": true,
  "guid": "...",              // deterministic GUID for this entity
  "id": "mario",              // character id (lowercase)
  "keyframes": [...],         // ALL keyframes from all animations, flat array
  "layers": [...],            // ALL layers from all animations, flat array
  "paletteMap": null,         // or { "paletteCollection": "...", "paletteMap": "..." }
  "pluginMetadata": {
    "com.fraymakers.FraymakersMetadata": {
      "objectType": "CHARACTER",
      "version": "0.4.0"
    }
  },
  "plugins": ["com.fraymakers.FraymakersMetadata"],
  "symbols": [...],           // ALL symbols (IMAGE, COLLISION_BOX, COLLISION_BODY, POINT)
  "tags": [],
  "terrains": [],
  "tilesets": [],
  "version": 14
}
```

### animation object

```json
{
  "$id": "...",         // deterministic GUID
  "name": "idle",       // Fraymakers animation name
  "layers": ["..."],    // ordered array of layer $ids
  "pluginMetadata": {}
}
```

empty animations (those whose IMAGE timeline carries no real symbols across all
frames) are dropped from the final entity. the one exception is a small allowlist
controlled by `populated_jabs` in `haxe_gen.rs`: when a character has exactly two
populated jabs the converter keeps `jab3` as an empty placeholder so the Script.hx
jab-chain references don't break at runtime.

### layer types

every animation typically has this layer stack (in order):
1. `LABEL` -- animation name label on frame 0, plus any inner FrameLabel tags.
2. `FRAME_SCRIPT` -- per-frame Haxe code (`code` is the function body, no wrapper).
3. `COLLISION_BODY` -- character ECB/body diamond, per frame.
4. `COLLISION_BOX` -- one layer per box instance (hitbox0, hurtbox0, etc.).
5. `POINT` -- one layer per `touchBox` (grab-hold point).
6. `IMAGE` -- one layer per depth slot (Image 0, Image 1, …).

#### LABEL layer

```json
{ "$id": "...", "name": "Labels", "type": "LABEL",
  "keyframes": ["kf_id"], "hidden": false, "locked": false, "pluginMetadata": {} }
```

LABEL keyframe:
```json
{ "$id": "...", "type": "LABEL", "length": 1, "name": "idle", "pluginMetadata": {} }
```

#### FRAME_SCRIPT layer

```json
{ "$id": "...", "name": "Scripts", "type": "FRAME_SCRIPT",
  "keyframes": [...], "hidden": false, "locked": false,
  "language": "", "pluginMetadata": {} }
```

FRAME_SCRIPT keyframe -- `code` is the function body **only** (no `function name() {`
wrapper). blank frames use `"code": ""`:

```json
{ "$id": "...", "type": "FRAME_SCRIPT", "length": 1,
  "code": "self.playAnimation(\"jab2\");", "pluginMetadata": {} }
```

#### COLLISION_BODY layer (ECB / body diamond)

the ECB is a 4-vertex diamond: foot (bottom), head (top), and two hip vertices at the
sides at the foot/head midpoint. `entity_gen.rs` computes the per-frame diamond as the
axis-aligned bounding box of that frame's HURTBOX-typed collision boxes, so the body
auto-fits the pose. consecutive frames with identical bodies are run-length encoded
into a single keyframe.

```json
{ "$id": "...", "name": "Body", "type": "COLLISION_BODY", "keyframes": [...],
  "defaultAlpha": 0.5, "defaultColor": "0xffa500",
  "defaultFoot": 0, "defaultHead": 86, "defaultHipWidth": 40,
  "defaultHipXOffset": 0, "defaultHipYOffset": 0, "pluginMetadata": {} }
```

COLLISION_BODY symbol:
```json
{ "$id": "...", "alpha": null, "color": null,
  "foot": 0, "head": 86, "hipWidth": 40, "hipXOffset": 0, "hipYOffset": 0,
  "pluginMetadata": {}, "type": "COLLISION_BODY" }
```

#### COLLISION_BOX layer

```json
{ "$id": "...", "name": "hitbox0", "type": "COLLISION_BOX", "keyframes": [...],
  "defaultAlpha": 0.5, "defaultColor": "0xff0000",
  "pluginMetadata": {
    "com.fraymakers.FraymakersMetadata": {
      "collisionBoxType": "HIT_BOX",
      "index": 0
    }
  } }
```

COLLISION_BOX symbol:
```json
{ "$id": "...", "alpha": 0.5, "color": "0xff0000",
  "pivotX": 24.0, "pivotY": 13.0,         // centre of the box (bottom-centre for itemBox)
  "pluginMetadata": {},
  "rotation": 12.5,                        // CW-positive degrees, normalized to [0, 360)
  "scaleX": 48.0,                          // width in pixels
  "scaleY": 26.0,                          // height in pixels
  "type": "COLLISION_BOX",
  "x": -54.0, "y": -35.0 }                 // top-left in world space, y-down
```

COLLISION_BOX keyframe -- blank frame uses `"symbol": null`:
```json
{ "$id": "...", "type": "COLLISION_BOX", "length": 2,
  "symbol": "sym_$id_or_null", "tweened": false, "tweenType": "LINEAR",
  "pluginMetadata": {} }
```

**Fraymakers collision-box type strings** (used in `collisionBoxType`):

| String | Description |
|---|---|
| `HIT_BOX` | Active hitbox |
| `HURT_BOX` | Hurtbox |
| `GRAB_BOX` | Grab range |
| `LEDGE_GRAB_BOX` | Ledge grab |
| `REFLECT_BOX` | Reflect / shield (from SSF2 `shieldBox` and `reflectBox`) |
| `COUNTER_BOX` | Counter / absorb (from SSF2 `absorbBox`) |

#### POINT layer

used for named points in space (grab hold position, pivot points, etc.).

```json
{ "$id": "...", "name": "grabholdpoint0", "type": "POINT", "keyframes": [...],
  "hidden": false, "locked": false,
  "pluginMetadata": {
    "com.fraymakers.FraymakersMetadata": {
      "pointType": "GRAB_HOLD_POINT"
    }
  } }
```

POINT symbol -- coordinate only, no size:
```json
{ "$id": "...", "alpha": 1, "color": "0xff0000",
  "pluginMetadata": {}, "rotation": 0, "type": "POINT",
  "x": 9.62, "y": -9.7 }
```

POINT keyframe:
```json
{ "$id": "...", "type": "POINT", "length": 1,
  "symbol": "sym_$id_or_null", "tweened": false, "tweenType": "LINEAR",
  "pluginMetadata": {} }
```

**known point types** (in `pluginMetadata.com.fraymakers.FraymakersMetadata.pointType`):
- `GRAB_HOLD_POINT` -- where a grabbed opponent is positioned (from SSF2 `touchBox`).
- `PIVOT_POINT` -- rotation pivot override.

#### IMAGE layer

```json
{ "$id": "...", "name": "Image 0", "type": "IMAGE", "keyframes": [...],
  "hidden": false, "locked": false, "pluginMetadata": {} }
```

IMAGE symbol -- **one is created per placement** (each anim/slot/frame gets its own
symbol; symbols are NOT shared across frames because the world matrix varies):

```json
{ "$id": "...", "alpha": 1,
  "imageAsset": "meta_guid",         // GUID from the PNG's .meta sidecar (NOT a file path)
  "pivotX": 0, "pivotY": 0,          // bitmap (0,0); shape_pivot offsets are folded into x/y
  "pluginMetadata": {},
  "rotation": 350.5,                  // CW-positive degrees, normalized to [0, 360)
  "scaleX": 1.1, "scaleY": 1.1,       // signed: negative = flip
  "type": "IMAGE",
  "x": -54.0, "y": -35.0 }            // world-space, y-down
```

the model FrayTools uses is: `world_pt = (x, y) + R(rot) · diag(sx, sy) · local_pt`.
the converter mirrors this exactly -- `x` / `y` come from the SWF world matrix's
translation plus a shape-pivot correction; rotation and scale from the matrix's linear
part. sheared placements are pre-rendered to a baked bitmap (see "skew handling" above)
and emitted as identity-rotation, identity-scale plain translations.

IMAGE keyframe:
```json
{ "$id": "...", "type": "IMAGE", "length": 3,
  "symbol": "sym_$id_or_null", "tweened": false, "tweenType": "LINEAR",
  "pluginMetadata": {} }
```

consecutive frames with the same symbol AND identical world matrix are run-length
encoded into one keyframe.

### .meta sidecar files

every PNG needs a `.meta` JSON file at the same path + `.meta` extension:
```json
{ "export": false, "guid": "deterministic-guid", "id": "",
  "pluginMetadata": {}, "plugins": [], "tags": [], "version": 2 }
```

the GUID in the `.meta` file is what `imageAsset` in IMAGE symbols references, not the
PNG file path.

### per-projectile and per-effect entities

each discovered projectile (SSF2 sprite carrying an `attack_idle` FrameLabel + a `stance`
PlaceObject) gets its own `library/entities/<name>.entity` plus script files at
`library/scripts/Projectile/<Pascal>{Script,Stats,HitboxStats,AnimationStats}.hx`.
animation names come from the inner sprite's FrameLabel tags when present, else fall back
to the FM template trio `projectileSpawn` / `projectileIdle` / `projectileDestroy`.

each discovered effect (root-level SymbolClass'd sprite that's neither a projectile, the
character itself, the head sprite, an `_fla.*` timeline, nor a HUD/icon) is emitted as a
plain `library/entities/<name>.entity` with one IMAGE layer per inner FrameLabel-derived
segment -- no scripts, no stats. the character's `Script.hx` references these via
`match.createVfx(new VfxStats({…}), self)` calls produced by the `attachEffect` rewriter
in `api_mappings.rs`.

## how FrayTools renders what we emit

> **not in this repo (compliance).** this repo doesn't carry a spec of how FrayTools
> interprets the `.entity` files we emit (the Y-negation, transform order, which box
> types honor rotation, pivot/scale rules, keyframe-length timing, the manifest/`.meta`
> binding, the palette shader). to respect Team Fray's wishes, we keep that
> reverse-engineering write-up out of the tracked repo (see "engine-side knowledge
> is not in this repo" below); please leave it that way.
>
> what you still need for `entity_gen.rs` work is captured structurally elsewhere in
> this file: the `.entity` schema (every layer/symbol/keyframe shape), the CW-positive
> `[0,360)` rotation convention the converter emits, the Y-down coordinate system, and
> the `.meta`-sidecar / manifest id binding -- all properties of the files **we** author.
> to re-derive FrayTools' render behaviour, do it locally against your own install and
> keep the notes in the gitignored `docs/` scratch space -- never in a tracked file.

---

## coordinate system

both SSF2 and Fraymakers use **y-down** screen coordinates (positive y = down).
no y-flip is needed between the two systems.

```
Origin: character foot (ground contact point)
Positive x: right
Positive y: down (into ground)
Negative y: up (into air)
```

world space = root MC transform applied to local SWF coordinates.

## animation name mapping (SSF2 → Fraymakers)

the SSF2 → FM animation-name table is **data-driven** via
`mappings/character/animations.jsonc`. keys:

- `ssf2_to_fm` -- SSF2 xframe / animation name (e.g. `stand`, `a_air_forward`) → FM
  animation name (e.g. `idle`, `aerial_forward`).
- `label_to_ssf2` -- sprite-symbol AnimLabel (lowercased, suffix stripped, e.g.
  `nair`) → SSF2 animation name.

loaded by `crate::mappings::character_animations()` in `src/mappings.rs`. used by
`extractor::build_ssf2_to_fm_anim`, `sprite_parser::static_ssf2_to_fm`, and the
sprite-symbol resolver `sprite_parser::extract_ssf2_anim_name`. edit this file (not
the Rust source) to fix animation-name mapping.

some SSF2 sprites pack multiple FM animations into one timeline separated by internal
FrameLabel tags (e.g. a "Jab" sprite contains jab1 / jab2 / jab3 / jab4; a "Strong"
sprite contains in/charge/attack). the splitter lives in `src/anim_splitter.rs` (and
`sprite_parser::sub_anim_splits` for the sprite-level equivalent). the label patterns
driving which splits are **hardcoded match arms** in `anim_splitter.rs` -- no external
rules file.

---

## UUID generation

all GUIDs in the entity are **deterministic**, seeded by `{char_id}::{context}` using
UUID v5 (SHA-1 namespace). this ensures regeneration produces the same entity
byte-for-byte (in the GUID dimension). see `src/uuid_gen.rs`.

---

## diagnostic binaries

~30 `--bin` targets exist for debugging (gated behind `--features dev-tools`).
the most useful selection:
```
dump_image_placement   — per-frame PlaceObject data for any sprite
dump_collision_box     — collision-box geometry for an animation
dump_images            — list all extracted bitmaps
dump_sprites           — list all DefineSprite symbols
dump_shape_bounds      — measure CollisonBox shape bounds
dump_shape_origins     — shape origin offsets
dump_pivots            — pivot points
dump_frame_labels      — frame labels inside a sprite timeline
dump_raw_frame         — raw tag dump for one frame
dump_inner_sprite      — inspect a nested (effect) sprite
dump_proj_states       — projectile state discovery
dump_stage             — root timeline inspection
dump_costumes          — costume tables from misc.ssf
dump_aerial_down_frames— targeted debug for the aerial-down animation
dump_trail_matrices    — trail-effect matrix inspection
check_shape_bitmap     — inspect a shape's bitmap fill + fill matrix
what_is_id             — identify what a numeric SWF character id refers to
```

these tools are the workbench for inspecting a SWF without re-deriving the format.
costume extraction is in-process inside `ssf2_converter` (no separate `extract_costumes`
binary).

usage example (the bins are dev-tools-gated, so run via cargo):
```bash
cargo run -p ssf2_converter --features dev-tools --bin dump_image_placement -- ../ssf2-ssfs/mario.ssf "FAir_42"
cargo run -p ssf2_converter --features dev-tools --bin dump_collision_box -- ../ssf2-ssfs/mario.ssf "a_air_forward"
```

## known issues / open questions

open converter issues and the prioritized TODO list live in
[`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md) -- the single home for converter status and
next steps. this document is the format reference, not the issue tracker; check
STATUS.md for what's currently broken, approximate, or unverified (shape-only menu
portraits, vector-only effect sprites, projectile-behaviour stubs, stat-scaling
approximations, and the rest).
